**Asymptotic Notations**

### **Introduction to Asymptotic Notation**
Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the **time complexity** of an algorithm. It helps in analyzing how the algorithm's performance scales with input size (**n**).

### **Big O Notation (O)**
- Represents the **upper bound** of an algorithm's time complexity.
- Describes the worst-case scenario.
- Example:
  - If an algorithm runs in **O(n²)**, it means its execution time will not exceed a quadratic function for large **n**.

### **Big Omega Notation (Ω)**
- Represents the **lower bound** of an algorithm’s time complexity.
- Describes the best-case scenario.
- Example:
  - If an algorithm has **Ω(n log n)** complexity, it means the algorithm will take at least this much time in the best case.

### **Big Theta Notation (Θ)**
- Represents the **tight bound** of an algorithm’s time complexity.
- Describes the average-case scenario when the upper and lower bounds are the same.
- Example:
  - If an algorithm has **Θ(n²)** complexity, it means its execution time grows proportionally to **n²** for large **n**.

### **Understanding Growth Rates**
- For large values of **n**, higher-degree functions dominate lower-degree ones:
  - **n² dominates n** → Quadratic functions grow faster than linear functions.
  - **n log n dominates log n** → Log-linear functions grow faster than logarithmic ones.

### **Importance of Asymptotic Notations**
- Helps in comparing different algorithms based on their efficiency.
- Crucial in determining the scalability and performance of an algorithm.
- Provides a mathematical foundation for analyzing algorithms beyond experimental execution.

By using these notations, developers can make informed decisions about selecting the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.
