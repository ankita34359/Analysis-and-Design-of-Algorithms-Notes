**Comparison of Various Time Complexities**

### **Introduction**
Time complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of input size (**n**). It helps in determining how an algorithm's execution time increases as **n** grows.

### **Different Types of Time Complexities (Increasing Order)**
1. **O(1) - Constant Time Complexity**
   - Execution time remains the same regardless of input size.
   - Example: Accessing an element in an array.

2. **O(log log n) - Double Logarithmic Time Complexity**
   - Grows slower than logarithmic time.
   - Example: Extremely fast-growing computations in specific cases.

3. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time Complexity**
   - Growth rate decreases as input size increases.
   - Example: Binary search algorithm.

4. **O(n) - Linear Time Complexity**
   - Execution time increases proportionally with input size.
   - Example: Traversing an array.

5. **O(n log n) - Log-Linear Time Complexity**
   - Used in efficient sorting algorithms.
   - Example: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

6. **O(n²) - Quadratic Time Complexity**
   - Execution time grows quadratically with input size.
   - Example: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort.

7. **O(n³) - Cubic Time Complexity**
   - Execution time increases cubically with input size.
   - Example: Matrix multiplication.

8. **O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time Complexity**
   - Growth rate doubles with each increment in input size.
   - Example: Recursive Fibonacci calculation.

9. **O(n!) - Factorial Time Complexity**
   - Grows extremely fast, impractical for large inputs.
   - Example: Brute-force solutions for NP-complete problems.

### **Comparison of Sorting Algorithm Complexities**
- **Efficient Sorting Algorithms**: O(n log n) (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Inefficient Sorting Algorithms**: O(n²) (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)

### **Time Complexity Graph Representation**
- **Graphical representation** shows how different complexities scale with input size.
- Exponential and factorial complexities grow the fastest, making them impractical for large inputs.

### **Conclusion**
Understanding different time complexities helps in selecting the most efficient algorithm based on the problem constraints and input size.
