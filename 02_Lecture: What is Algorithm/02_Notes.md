# **Introduction to Algorithms**

### **Definition of Algorithm**
An **algorithm** is a **finite set of steps** or **instructions** designed to solve a specific problem. It must have:
- A **finite number of instructions**
- A **finite execution time**
- Clear and unambiguous steps

### **Key Characteristics of an Algorithm**
1. **Finiteness**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
2. **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined and unambiguous.
3. **Input**: It may have zero or more inputs.
4. **Output**: It must produce at least one output.
5. **Effectiveness**: Each operation should be simple and feasible.

### **Algorithm Analysis**
Algorithm analysis helps in evaluating algorithms based on their **time** and **space complexity**.

1. **Time Complexity**: Measures the time required to execute the algorithm.
2. **Space Complexity**: Measures the memory consumed by the algorithm.

### **Types of Algorithm Analysis**
1. **A Priori Analysis (Before Execution)**
   - Theoretical analysis of an algorithm.
   - Done without implementing the algorithm.
   - Focuses on worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios.

2. **A Posteriori Analysis (After Execution)**
   - Empirical analysis based on actual implementation.
   - Measures real-world performance on different inputs.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
Time complexity is analyzed by calculating the number of iterations an algorithm performs. Common complexities include:
- **O(1):** Constant time
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic time
- **O(n):** Linear time
- **O(n log n):** Log-linear time
- **O(nÂ²):** Quadratic time

### **Performance Analysis of Algorithms**
Performance is evaluated based on:
- **Execution Time:** How fast the algorithm runs.
- **Memory Usage:** The amount of space it consumes.
- **Scalability:** How well it handles large inputs.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental in designing efficient algorithms for problem-solving.
